Description:
        
MyShell is a simple shell implementation in C, running on Linux.

Compile:
        make
Run:
        ./myshell

Assumption:
        1. Assume there's at least one space before 2> redirection.
        2. When there are multiple redirection, take the last one.

File:
        myshell: main program
        utils: contains several ultility function
        parser: parse user input
        run: runtime of shell
        io: handle input/output
        Makefile:
        README:

        source file in src/
        corresponding header file in include/

        input: sample input
        output: sample output

Solution:
        parser: 
        parse the command line into a list of command_t
        which seperated by "|". It stores argc,argv and redirected 
        input/ouput/error stream.

        run:
        loop aroung the command list and run it.
        use only one pair of pipe fds  to handle all pipes.
